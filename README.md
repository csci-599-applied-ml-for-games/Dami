## Project Detail:

We created a racing game in a snowy terrain by Unity, where players have to control an flying object that goes through the race track without crashing into obstacles. Specifically, the flying object should fly through each checkpoint within few seconds and complete two laps of the race. 

During the travel, players also need to overcome several environmental physical challenges, including rocks and water. Once the flying object coinciding with obstacles, it will crash immediately, and players have to restart from the last checkpoint.

With the using of the ML-Agent, which provides an implementation of PPO algorithm, we are able to train the flying objects as agents to travel around the race track  without running into obstacles within the time limitation.
